## Requirements

1. Create project using any technology of your preference. Itâ€™s perfectly OK to use native code or any framework or librarie.
2. Use this API to display posts: https://stormy-shelf-93141.herokuapp.com/ â€“ `_page` and `_limit` query parameters are available.
3. We appreciate _a readable & clean code_.
4. Please publish your source code into Github with a README.md file detailing the instructions on how to get the app up and running.
