# Mobile Test Project
You should see this challenge as an opportunity to create an app following modern development best practices (given your platform of choice), but also feel free to use your own app architecture preferences (coding standards, code organization, third-party libraries, etc). Itâ€™s perfectly fine to use native code or any framework or library.

## Scope
**1. Infinite scroll posts screen**

**2. Single post screen**

**3. Contact modal**

## Requirements
1. Convert the following design into live code app.
2. Use this API to display posts: https://stormy-shelf-93141.herokuapp.com/ â€“ `_page` and `_limit` query parameters are available.

## Deliverables
The project source code and dependencies should be made available in GitHub. Here are the steps you should follow:
1. Create a public repository on GitHub (create an account if you don't have one).
2. Create a "development" branch and commit the code to it. Do not push the code to the master branch.
3. Create a "screenshots" sub-folder and include at least two screenshots of the app.
4. Include a README file that describes:
  - Special build instructions, if any
  - List of third-party libraries used and short description of why/how they were used
5. Once the work is complete, create a pull request from "development" into "master" and send us the link.
6. Avoid using huge commits hiding your progress. Feel free to work on a branch and use rebase to adjust your commits before submitting the final version.

## Design
Design is available in Figma at [https://www.figma.com/file/LA0NAQljFwhY8KfDUijKVBhF/Coderockr-Mobile-Test](https://www.figma.com/file/LA0NAQljFwhY8KfDUijKVBhF/Coderockr-Mobile-Test). If you haven't already, sign up for a free Figma account, so you can work with the design.

## Supported OS's
Ensure that the App work and display correctly in the following operational sistems:

- iOS (latest version)
- Android (latest version)

## Coding Standards
When working on the project be as clean and consistent as possible.

## Project Deadline
